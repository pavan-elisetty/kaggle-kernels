However, we see that dropping columns performs slightly better! While this can probably partially be attributed to noise in the dataset, another potential explanation is that the imputation method is not a great match to this dataset. That is, maybe instead of filling in the mean value, it makes more sense to set every missing value to a value of 0, to fill in the most frequently encountered value, or to use some other method. For instance, consider the GarageYrBlt column (which indicates the year that the garage was built). It's likely that in some cases, a missing value could indicate a house that does not have a garage. Does it make more sense to fill in the median value along each column in this case? Or could we get better results by filling in the minimum value along each column? It's not quite clear what's best in this case, but perhaps we can rule out some options immediately - for instance, setting missing values in this column to 0 is likely to yield horrible results!\n\"\"\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
