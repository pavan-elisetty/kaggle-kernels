(Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n\nThen, we start the cycle:\n\nFirst, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\nThese predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).\nThen, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\nFinally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n... repeat!\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nIn this example, you'll work with the XGBoost library. XGBoost stands for extreme gradient boosting, which is an implementation of gradient boosting with several additional features focused on performance and speed. (Scikit-learn has another version of gradient boosting, but XGBoost has some technical advantages.)\n\nIn the next code cell, we import the scikit-learn API for XGBoost (xgboost.XGBRegressor). This allows us to build and fit a model just as we would in scikit-learn. As you'll see in the output, the XGBRegressor class has many tunable parameters -- you'll learn about those soon!\n\"\"\"\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nParameter Tuning\nXGBoost has a few parameters that can dramatically affect accuracy and training speed. The first parameters you should understand are:\n\nn_estimators\nn_estimators specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above. It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.\n\nToo low a value causes underfitting, which leads to inaccurate predictions on both training data and test data.\nToo high a value causes overfitting, which causes accurate predictions on training data, but inaccurate predictions on test data (which is what we care about).\nTypical values range from 100-1000, though this depends a lot on the learning_rate parameter discussed below.\n\nearly_stopping_rounds\nearly_stopping_rounds offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n\nSince random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n\nWhen using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.\n\"\"\"\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)\nmy_model.fit(X_train, y_train, \n             early_stopping_rounds=5, \n             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)],\n             verbose=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nIf you later want to fit a model with all of your data, set n_estimators to whatever value you found to be optimal when run with early stopping.\n\nlearning_rate\nInstead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.\n\nThis means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.\n\nIn general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle.
